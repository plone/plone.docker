# JSON capability probe, run through the image's own script runner:
#   docker run --rm <image> run /json-probe.py
#
# Used by shared/smoke-test.sh. It must be run through `zopectl run` (tarball
# era) or `bin/instance run` (buildout era) rather than the bare interpreter:
# [V 2026-08-27] 3.3 gets simplejson from an EGG in the buildout-cache, which
# only those runners put on sys.path, while 1.0-3.2 get it from site-packages,
# which both see. Probing "$PYTHON" directly would therefore report 3.3 as
# broken while it is in fact fine -- and, worse, would not be testing the way
# anybody actually runs an extraction script.
#
# The runners do NOT reliably propagate a script's exit status (the same reason
# docker-entrypoint*.sh captures output instead of trusting `||`), so success is
# signalled by printing a marker the caller greps for. A traceback prints no
# marker and therefore fails the gate.
