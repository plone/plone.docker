# Product load check.
#
# Zope answers HTTP and authenticates even when every Plone product failed to
# import, so the two assertions above can and do pass on a completely unusable
# Plone. [V 2026-08-20] With no PIL in the image, CMFPlone, Archetypes and
# ATContentTypes all fail at "from PIL import Image" in CMFPlone/utils.py:4.
#
# [V 2026-08-20] D2/D4 are settled: the image ships PIL 1.1.6, so a clean
# product load is now the expected state and this check is FATAL by default.
# Set SMOKE_STRICT_PRODUCTS=0 to downgrade it to a warning (e.g. while
# bringing up a new version directory that has a known-broken product).
# [V 2026-08-20] The log file name is NOT stable across eras, and getting this
# wrong makes the check silently vacuous rather than noisy:
#   tarball era (2.0-3.0), mkzopeinstance : /data/log/event.log
#   buildout era (3.1+),   zope2instance  : /data/log/instance.log
# The first 3.1 run "passed" this check against a path that did not exist. So
# glob the directory, and treat *finding no log at all* as a failure — that way
# a future rename breaks the build instead of quietly disabling the gate.

# JSON gate.
#
# [V 2026-08-27] Python grew a stdlib `json` only in 2.6, so 1.0 through 3.3
# (Python 2.3/2.4) have no JSON at all unless simplejson is installed — and
# scripted content extraction, which is the entire point of these images, is
# painful without it. 4.0+ get it from the stdlib.
#
# Asserted as a CAPABILITY — "this image can round-trip JSON the way a script
# actually runs" — rather than per-version, so a single check covers the whole
# matrix: a real gate below 4.0, where nothing satisfies it by accident, and
# free above.
#
# Two deliberate choices, both verified rather than assumed [V 2026-08-27]:
#
#   * It runs a SECOND, throwaway container instead of exec-ing into the live
#     one. The runners open the ZODB, which the running instance already holds
#     locked, and `run` is the code path a real extraction script takes.
#   * It goes through that runner rather than "$PYTHON" directly. 3.3 gets
#     simplejson from a buildout-cache EGG, which only the runner puts on
#     sys.path; probing the bare interpreter reports 3.3 as broken when it is
#     fine, and tests a path nobody uses.
#
# `zopectl run` / `bin/instance run` do not reliably propagate a script exit
# status — the same reason docker-entrypoint*.sh captures output rather than
# trusting `||` — so success is a marker in the OUTPUT, not the status.
