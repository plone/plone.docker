# The mitigations below are applied by CAPABILITY DETECTION, not by version
# number. [V 2026-08-20] The interpreters in this matrix genuinely differ:
#
#   Python   BASECFLAGS override   --without-cxx   multiarch patch
#   2.3.7    needed                supported       needed
#   2.4.6    needed                supported       needed
#   2.6.9    NOT needed (configure sets -fwrapv itself)  ABSENT   needed
#   2.7.18   NOT needed            ABSENT          NOT needed (native)
#
# Hardcoding the 2.4-era behaviour would fail 2.6 on ./configure and 2.7 on its
# own grep guards, so each mitigation probes for the condition it fixes.

# --- Mitigation 1: posix_close symbol collision -----------------------------
# glibc declares posix_close(); the old Modules/posixmodule.c defines its own.
# Present in 2.3 through 2.7; renamed wherever found.
if [ "$(grep -c '\bposix_close\b' Modules/posixmodule.c)" -ge 1 ]; then
    sed -i 's/\bposix_close\b/py2x_posix_close/g' Modules/posixmodule.c
    echo "mitigation: renamed posix_close"
fi

# --- Mitigation 2: multiarch library search paths ---------------------------
# [V 2026-08-20] Python 2.3-2.6 predate Debian multiarch (2011). setup.py looks
# for libraries in /lib and /usr/lib, but bookworm keeps libz.so, libcrypt.so
# and friends ONLY under /usr/lib/<triplet>. Detection fails, setup.py SILENTLY
# skips the extension (renaming it <name>_failed.so), and the breakage surfaces
# much later as "ImportError: No module named zlib".
#
# NOTE: passing LDFLAGS=-L<triplet> to ./configure does NOT help — setup.py's
# LDFLAGS-to-lib_dirs handling is guarded by `if platform == 'darwin'`.
#
# Python 2.7 grew add_multiarch_paths(), which runs `gcc -print-multiarch`
# itself — exactly this fix, upstream. Patching it there would be both
# redundant and impossible (the anchors below do not exist in 2.7's setup.py),
# so skip when the interpreter already handles it.
if [ "$(grep -c 'def add_multiarch_paths' setup.py)" -ge 1 ]; then
    echo "mitigation: multiarch patch SKIPPED (interpreter has add_multiarch_paths)"

    # [V 2026-08-20] The assignment is formatted differently across versions:
    #   2.3.7: lib_dirs = self.compiler.library_dirs + ['/lib', '/usr/lib']
    #   2.4.6: lib_dirs = self.compiler.library_dirs + [
    #                                                  '/lib64', '/usr/lib64',
    # so anchor on the common prefix and insert immediately after the '[',
    # rather than matching the list contents.

# --- Mitigation 3: configure flags ------------------------------------------
#   --without-cxx : skip C++ main detection (fragile, unused). 2.6 replaced it
#                   with --with-cxx-main and 2.7 dropped the "without" spelling
#                   entirely, so passing it there aborts ./configure.
#   BASECFLAGS    : -fno-strict-aliasing/-fwrapv for the pre-C99-aliasing code.
#                   2.6+ already set -fwrapv themselves; overriding BASECFLAGS
#                   there would REPLACE the flags configure worked out, so it is
#                   only forced on interpreters that lack it.
# _ssl, curses, bsddb, tkinter and nis are EXPECTED to fail to build against a
# modern userland. They are optional; ZServer speaks plain HTTP.
