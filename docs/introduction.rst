`Plone Docker Images <https://hub.docker.com/r/plone/plone/>`_ are maintanied by 
the `Plone Community <https://plone.org>`_.

These images are a compromise between the `best practices for writing Dockerfiles <https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/>`_
and `installing Plone using the Unified UNIX Installer <https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation.html>`_.

.. warning::

   Please **do not** copy one of the examples of this documentation and use it in
   production !
   
   If you want to use it in production, you need to have solid kownledge about
   Docker and hosting.

Our images are excelent for test driving Plone, checking add-ons or as a base for
development/theming.
