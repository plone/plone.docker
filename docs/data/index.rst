Data
====

.. note::

  There are several ways to store data used by applications that run in
  Docker containers.

  We encourage users of the `Plone` images to familiarize
  themselves with the options available.

`The Docker documentation <https://docs.docker.com/>`_ is a good starting point for understanding the different
storage options and variations.

Data Volumes
============

Let Docker manage the storage of your database data
`by writing the database files to disk on the host system using its own internal volume management <https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/>`_.

The advantages of this approach is that you can deploy your Plone stack anywhere,
without having to prepare hosts in advance or care about read/write permission
or selinux policy rules.

The downside is that the files may be hard to locate for tools and applications
that run directly on the host system, for example outside containers.

Use data volumes with Plone on the command line

.. code-block:: shell

   docker run --name plone \
   	--volume=plone-data:/data \
   	-p 8080:8080 \
   	plone

Or with `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose>`_

Add ``docker-compose.yml`` file

.. code-block:: yaml

   version: "2"
   services:
     plone:
       image: plone
       volumes:
       - data:/data
       ports:
       - "8080:8080"

   volumes:
     data:

Start the Plone stack

.. code-block:: shell

   docker-compose up


Host Directories As Data Volumes
================================

Create data directories on the host system and `mount these to a directory visible from inside the container <https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume>`_.

This places the database files in a known location on the host system.

Tools and applications on the host system can access the files.

The downside is that the user needs to make sure that the directory exists,
and that for example directory permissions and other security mechanisms
on the host system are set up correctly.

- Create data directories on a suitable volume on your host system, for example ``/var/local/data/filestorage`` and ``/var/local/data/blobstorage``

- Start your ``Plone`` container

.. code-block:: shell

   docker run -v /var/local/data/filestorage:/data/filestorage \
   	 -v /var/local/data/blobstorage:/data/blobstorage \
   	 -d plone

The *-v /path/to/filestorage:/data/filestorage* part of the command mounts the *-v /path/to/filestorage* directory from the underlying host system as /data/filestorage inside the container, where Plone will look for/create the Data.fs database file.

The *-v /path/to/blobstorage:/data/blobstorage* part of the command mounts the *-v /path/to/blobstorage* directory from the underlying host system as /data/blobstorage where blobs will be stored.

Make sure that Plone has access to read/write within these folders

.. code-block:: shell

   chown -R 500:500 /var/local/data

.. note::

   Users on host systems with SELinux enabled may see issues with this.

   The current workaround is to assign the relevant SELinux policy type to the
   new data directory so that the container will be allowed to access it


.. code-block:: shell

   chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /var/local/data
