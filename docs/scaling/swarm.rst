.. topic:: Description

   The following example creates two ZEO instances which connects to the ZEO server via a dedicated network (zeo-net).

.. topic:: Note

   This example assumes that Swarm manager node is also the load balancing node.

   If more nodes are added make sure that ZEO server has a constraint to run only on a specific node.
   Otherwise you might loose your site temporary when ZEO server migrates to another node (and new volume is created there).

   This can be mitigated by using distributed volume driver on mounting the zeo-data from NFS.

Load balancer (`Traefik <https://traefik.io/>`_) and ZEO instances connect via their own network (traefik-net).

Only Traefik exposes its ports (80/TCP and 8080/TCP).

Traefik monitoring interface is at port 8080 and Plone trafik goes through the port 80.

You need to be running Docker Engine 1.13 on newer for this example to work.
First you need to put Docker in swarm mode if it is not already:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker swarm init

Create plone-compose.yml with following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

   --
   version: "3"
   services:
     traefik:
       image: library/traefik:latest
       command: --docker --docker.swarmmode --docker.domain=traefik --docker.watch --web
       ports:
         - "80:80"
         - "8080:8080"
       networks:
         - traefik-net
       volumes:
         - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
       deploy:
         mode: global
         placement:
           constraints:
             - node.role == manager
     instance:
       image: library/plone:latest
       hostname: plone
       networks:
         - traefik-net
         - zeo-net
       environment:
         - ZEO_ADDRESS=zeo:8080
       deploy:
         replicas: 2
         labels:
           traefik.docker.network: traefik-net
           traefik.port: 8080
           traefik.frontend.rule: Host:plone.traefik
           traefik.backend.loadbalancer.method: drr
     zeo:
       hostname: zeo
       image: library/plone:latest
       command: zeo
       volumes:
         - zeo-data:/data
       networks:
         - zeo-net
       deploy:
         mode: global

   volumes:
       zeo-data:

   networks:
       zeo-net:
       traefik-net:

Deploy the stack with following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker deploy plone --compose-file plone-compose.yml

Add the following to you /etc/hosts file:

``127.0.0.1	plone.traefik``

Open your browser to http://plone.traefik/ and create a Plone site (use the default values).

After the site is created you can modify the traefik.frontend.rule label so that Traefik loads the site directly from the domain root:

traefik.frontend.rule: *Host:plone.traefik;AddPrefix:/VirtualHostBase/http/plone.traefik:80/Plone/VirtualHostRoot*

Redeploy the configuration with the same command as before:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker deploy plone --compose-file plone-compose.yml
